Description of the files in the folder "0_data_calibr"

- "calibr_inputs_TEMPLATE" - file with inputs for the calibration. To be used in the code the suffix "_TEMPLATE" needs to be removed (so that it's named just "calibr_inputs")

- "Best_fit_incidence_rate_by_age_EXAMPLE" - example of the output for best-fitting incidence rate of symptomatic dengue, by age (same age groups as what is used for incidence in the file "calibr_inputs"; average over the analysis period) --> should be compared with the input incidence rate (by age)
- "Best_fit_incidence_rate_by_month_EXAMPLE" - example of the output for best-fitting incidence rate of symptomtaic dengue, by calendar month (average over the anlaysis period) --> shoul dbe compared with the input incidence rate (by calendar month)
- "Best_fit_seroprevalence_EXAMPLE" - example of the output for best-fitting seroprevalence, by year of age (average over the analysis period)
- "Best_fit_nb_inf_by_serotype_EXAMPLE" - example of the output for the nb of infections, by serotype, for each year of the analysis period; with the best-fitting values of calibrated parameters --> allows seeing how the serotype distribution looks like over the analysis period
