#Theta is a modifying factor applied to the force of infection for hosts in order to take into account:
# - The impossibility of co-infection,
# - The presence of cross-protection & relative risk of being infected during the cross-protection period,
# - The maximum allowed number of infections, and
# - The presence of susceptibility enhancement & increase in susceptibility after the first (or each) infection

#This function calculates the array theta for UNVACCINATED HOSTS.
#It outputs a 3D array containing the value of theta for each combination of k, l and m. Here, the indices k, l and m DO NOT always represent the status for DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 
#(as it is the case in the general notation of the model equations). Instead, they represent the three serotypes that are not being considered in the current infection process. 
#For instance, in the infection process for DENV-1, the indices k, l and m will indeed represent the status for DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. 
#However, in the infection process for DENV-2, they will represent the status for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Same for the other serotypes.

#The IMPOSSIBILITY OF CO-INFECTION is taken into account by setting the value of theta to zero if at least one of the indices k,l or m is equal to 2 or 3 (which indicates that the
#individual is currently exposed to or infected with another serotype). The theta equal to zero is then applied to the force of infection for the serotype being considered, 
#thus making an infection with this serotype impossible. This is done in the infection process for each serotype, thus guaranteeing that no new infection can occur while another infection is ongoing.

#Similarly, the IMPACT OF CROSS-PROTECTION is taken into account by setting the value of theta equal to the parameter gammaCP (relative risk of being infected during the cross-protection period). 
#This is done if k,l or m are equal to 4, which indicates that the individual is currently cross-protected following an earlier infection with another serotype.

#If the indices k,l and m indicate that the host has already had the MAXIMUM ALLOWED NUMBER OF INFECTIONS, theta is set to zero to make a new infection impossible.

#Finally, the value of theta can be greater than 1 in the presence of SUSCEPTIBILITY ENHANCEMENT (after the first or after each infection).

#This function calculates the arrays theta for VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS.
#Two separate arrays are calculated - for the individuals who were seronegative and seropositive at the moment of vaccination. The calculation process is identical for the 
#both arrays, but the function is called twice with the different sets of vaccine efficacy values (object eta). 

#In addition to the effects considered for unvaccinated population (impossibility of co-infection, presence of cross-protection etc.), the efficacy of the vaccine is taken into account.
#To do so, the array theta now has two additional dimensions for:
#-Infecting serotype (as the vaccine efficacy may be serotype-specific),
#-Age group (determining, for each cohort, how long ago vaccination took place and, thus, remaining efficacy).
#These additional effects are captured in the array eta (for the calculation details see function ParmsVac_GetEta in the script 13_parms_vac.R)

#The function below, thus, returns a 5D array with the values of theta for each age group, serotype and combination of indices k, l and m.
