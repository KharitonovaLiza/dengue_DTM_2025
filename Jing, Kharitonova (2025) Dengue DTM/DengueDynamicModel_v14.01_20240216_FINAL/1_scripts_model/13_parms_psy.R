#Psy is a modifying factor used in the calculation of the force of infection for vectors. It represents the relative infectiousness of different categories of hosts (i.e. their relative contribution into 
#the force of infection). The infectiousness depends on:
#- Whether the infection is symptomatic or asymptomatic, and
#- Whether the host is vaccinated or not (the model allows exploring a change in the transmission potential of vaccinated individuals, including sterile immunity).

#Since the model does not include explicit compartments for symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, the value of psy represents the average infectiousness weighted by the proportions of symptomatic and
#asymptomatic infections. These proportions, in their turn, depend on the infection type (primary, secondary or post-secondary), which can be determined by observing the number of previous infections.
#The function below outputs a 3D array where each elements is the relative infectiousness for each combination of the indices k, l and m. Similarly to the calculation of other array objects,
#here the indices k, l and m DO NOT always represent the status for DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 (as it is the case in the general notation of the model equations). Instead, they represent the three serotypes
#other than the one being considered in the current infection process. For instance, in the infection process for DENV-1, the indices k, l and m will indeed represent the status for DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. 
#However, in the infection process for DENV-2, they will represent the status for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Same for the other serotypes.

#The proportions of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections may as well depend on the host's vaccination status. The present function is, thus, called multiple times and a different array psy is calculated
#for each population category, including:
#-Unvaccinated hosts (called by the function ParmsEpi_Initialise)
#-Vaccinated hosts (seronegative at vaccination; called by the function ParmsVac_Initialise)
#-Vaccinated hosts (seropositive at vaccination; called by the function ParmsVac_Initialise)
